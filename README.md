# TheReadingCircle

Share the love of reading with others by sharing your collection of books.  This web application will track the location of books in the shared collection and whether it's available to be borrowed for reading.

This is a demo single-URL application done in a couple days using only jQuery and a REST server.  To login, try the "chenglim" reader.  To start new session, simply re-load page.
